        <h3>  Tyrannosaurus Rex (T. rex)</h3>
        <p> Tyrannosaurus rex, often called the "King of the Dinosaurs," was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs. It lived about 68 to 66 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. With a massive skull, bone-crushing jaws, and tiny but famous arms, T. rex was a top predator.</p>
        <h3>  Brachiosaurus </h3>
        <p> Brachiosaurus was a giant, long-necked herbivore from the Late Jurassic period. Unlike many other sauropods, its front legs were longer than its back legs, giving it a giraffe-like stance. It could reach tall trees to feed on leaves.</p>
